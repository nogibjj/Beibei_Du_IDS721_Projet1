# Beibei_Du_IDS721_Projet1

## Cloud Continuous Delivery of Microservice (MLOps or Data Engineering Focused)
- Create a Microservice in Flask or Fast API
- Push source code to Github
- Configure Build System to Deploy changes
- Use IaC (Infrastructure as Code) to deploy code
- Use either AWS, Azure, GCP (recommended services include Google App Engine, AWS App Runner or Azure App Services)
- Containerization is optional, but recommended: Create a virtual environment

## Mindmap
1. Find an interested csv online 
2. Cleaned the dataset if needed
3. Take a few columns and manipualte some calculations using Rust
4. Microservices

## Flask Framework
### Examples of the app in `app2.py`
1. china is not in the dataset, thus it will return "The country is not in the dataset"
